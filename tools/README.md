# spinel tools

Developer tools that ship with the compiler. They are written in the
spinel subset and compiled by `spinel` itself, so their only runtime
dependency is `cc` -- the same as the compiler. `make` builds them
(`build/spinel-<name>`) and `make install` places them on `PATH` beside
`spinel`, so each is invoked like a subcommand:

```
spinel-doctor app.rb
spinel-reduce app.rb
spinel-flatten app.rb
spinel diff app.rb        # = spinel-diff app.rb; the compiler dispatches it
```

They locate the compiler at run time via, in order: `$SPINEL` (an
explicit path), `$SPINEL_DIR/spinel`, then `spinel` on `PATH`.

## spinel-doctor

One health report for a program. Independent legs:

- **build** -- compiles to a binary; reports any compile / codegen /
  C-build failure (with `--line-map`, so C errors point at Ruby lines).
- **unsupported** -- codegen gaps that degrade to a stub.
- **unresolved** -- calls that silently degrade to `nil`/`0` where CRuby
  would raise (via `SPINEL_WARN_UNRESOLVED`).
- **inference** -- methods spinel widened to `untyped` (the boxed poly
  slow path).
- **advice** -- where the boxed slow path will cost: boxed operations in
  the generated C, ranked by loop depth and mapped back to source lines.
  Depth propagates across the static call graph -- a method reached only
  from a deep nest ranks at its callers' depth, not at zero. Still
  static, so it ranks by *expected* cost with no time axis -- a deep
  startup nest can outrank per-frame work of the same depth; confirm
  with a profiler before optimizing
  ([`docs/profiling.md`](../docs/profiling.md)).
- **requires** -- non-relative `require`s spinel treats as native / no-op.
- **behavior** -- optional: compiled output vs CRuby; needs `ruby` on
  `PATH` and skips cleanly otherwise.

```
spinel-doctor [--only a,b] [--skip a,b] [--behavior] [--quiet] app.rb
```

Exit `0` clean, `1` when any leg reports an error-severity finding.

## spinel-reduce

Delta-debug (ddmin) a degrading program down to a minimal input that
still reproduces a chosen failure. Re-runs `spinel` only.

```
spinel-reduce [--oracle build|unsupported|unresolved] \
              [--oracle-cmd 'CMD {}'] [-o OUT] app.rb
```

`--oracle` selects the built-in interestingness test (default `build` =
spinel exits non-zero). `--oracle-cmd` is an escape hatch: `{}` is
replaced by the candidate file and the candidate is kept when `CMD`
exits `0`. Flatten multi-file programs first so reduce has one input.

## spinel-flatten

Inline a `require_relative` graph into one self-contained file, so
`spinel-reduce` and bug reports operate on a single input.

```
spinel-flatten [-o OUT] app.rb
```

## compile_scale

`make bench-compile` (or `ruby tools/compile_scale.rb [--cc] [--check] K...`)
generates the synthetic program of `compile_scale_gen.rb` -- K units of a
model, a store, a subclass of a shared base and a driver (#4847) -- and times
spinel's analysis (`--emit-rbs`) and C emission (`-c`) at each K, printing the
growth between consecutive sizes. The program is linear in K, so a linear
phase shows x2 per doubling. `--cc` also builds the binary; `--check` compares
its output with CRuby's.

## speed_ledger

`make bench-ledger` (or `ruby tools/speed_ledger.rb`) says what a change costs
or saves at run time. It compiles each benchmark with the default `spinel`
build, checks the output against its `.expected` file, and counts the
instructions the program retires under `valgrind --tool=callgrind`, split by
the layer of the runtime they were spent in:

```
benchmark                 Ir   alloc collect    hash  string   array      io    libc     gen       allocs  rss MB
gcbench        3,427,621,896    24.1    17.3     0.0     0.0     0.0     0.0     0.3    58.3   15,333,862   105.5
csv_process    2,179,608,614    17.4     4.2    16.2    40.1     6.6     0.0    13.0     2.6    5,068,420     3.8
io_wordcount     235,816,569    14.0     3.2    16.5    27.2     3.2     7.3    25.8     2.8      540,236     2.9
```

`Ir` is the instruction count, the layer columns are percentages of it,
`allocs` is the number of objects allocated (`SPINEL_ALLOC_REPORT`) and
`rss MB` the peak resident memory of a native run. It is a CRuby script, like
`compile_scale`, and needs valgrind.

- `ruby tools/speed_ledger.rb [--set narrow|all|NAME,NAME...]` prints the
  table. `narrow`, the default, is the eight benchmarks at the bottom of the
  README's table; `all` is every benchmark that does not start threads.
  `--json FILE` writes the same rows for a script to read.
- `make bench-ledger` (`--check`) measures the benchmarks in
  `benchmark/speed-ledger.tsv` and fails when one rose by more than 0.5%
  (`--tolerance PCT`). The baseline names the C compiler, valgrind and
  architecture it was measured with; on any other the comparison still
  prints, as indicative, and nothing fails. `make bench-ledger-update`
  (`--update`) rewrites it.
- `ruby tools/speed_ledger.rb --against REV` builds `REV` in a temporary
  worktree, measures both compilers on the benchmarks of this tree, and prints
  before, after and the change per benchmark, then the geometric mean. That is
  the row a speed change should carry. `--against-tree DIR` compares against a
  tree that is already built.

Why instructions and not seconds: the same build repeats to a few parts in a
million on a busy machine (`io_wordcount` moved by 1,126 of 235,815,431
between two runs), so a 0.3% change is a result where wall time would lose it
in the noise. The measured program is started with a fixed environment for
the same reason: the loader and `getenv` walk every variable. What the count
does not price is a cache miss or a mispredicted branch, so confirm a win on
the clock, with the two builds interleaved, before quoting it.

How the layers are decided (`speed_ledger_lib.rb`, tested by
`test/tools_speed_ledger.rb`): a function in a shared object is `libc`; the
others go by name, `sp_gc_alloc` and the slab's allocation side to `alloc`,
the rest of the collector to `collect`, and so on; a function no rule names is
`gen`. The C compiler inlines much of the runtime into the program -- the
write barrier, the root push, typed array reads -- and inlined instructions
carry the name of the function they landed in, so `gen` is the compiled
program plus whatever was inlined into it. A function-level split cannot do
better without `-g`, and `spinel -g` does not emit the same code. The whole
`narrow` set takes about half a minute on four cores and `all` under three
minutes; callgrind runs a program some fifty times slower than native.

## call_binding_probe

`ruby tools/call_binding_probe.rb [--strength T | --random N] [--seed S]
[--only F=L,..]` asks CRuby and spinel the same calls and compares the
answers, case by case. It is a CRuby script, like `compile_scale`, not one
of the tools `make` builds. A case, generated by `call_binding_gen.rb`, is
one row of its factors: the path the call takes to its parameters (a method,
`send`, `Method#call`, `bind_call`, a receiver of two classes, a class
value, a parent's class method through a subclass's `Method`, an inlined
yield, `initialize`, `raise C, msg`, `super` into a class and into an
included or prepended module, `...` and anonymous forwarding,
`instance_exec`, a block given to `yield`, a proc, a lambda, Struct and Data
construction), the parameter list (a default may read an instance variable
or a global), the arguments (their count against the parameters' window,
splats, literal keywords in the parameters' order or not, `**` operands and
where they sit), the class of one argument's value, where the values come
from (literals, values that log the order they run in, a read of a local or
an instance variable a later argument changes, or an assignment to the
variable a default reads), how many calls reach the parameters (a `Method`
local may be set to another target between two, or to nine targets), a class
of its own defining a method of the same name, the child's own parameters
when a bare `super` forwards them, whether the callee grows a String
argument in place and the caller prints it after (itself or through a method
it hands it to, which another call may give an Array), the block passed (or
handed on by an anonymous `&` forwarder), whether a method that yields to
the block also keeps it and runs it later with values of another type, and
whether the program is compiled with `--int-overflow=promote` (the cases of
one program share it). The argument levels follow the decisions CRuby's
binding makes (`vm_args.c`); the others each ask for a kind of bug that was
found by hand past the probe, named in the comments at `FACTORS`. The rows
are a covering array: every combination of levels of any T factors (default
3) is asked for by some row. A row asks for levels a case cannot always take
(a rebound `Method` local on a path with no `Method`, or an argument
assigning the instance variable a default reads, on a path whose method has
another self), so each case records the levels it did take, and the summary
says how many of the combinations the cases took -- at strength 2, 6716 of
7060, at strength 3, 217453 of 248186. `--only name_clash=sibling,seed=poly`
pins factors to a level each, leaving out the cases that cannot take them,
to ask one level's combinations without a whole run. Ruby that does not parse is no case; an exception CRuby
raises is part of the expected answer.

A difference is a finding. A program that spinel refuses, whose C does not
build, that crashes or that runs out of time is split until one case carries
it -- first by the cases its diagnostics' lines (through spinel's `#line`
map) name, or, for a crash or a timeout, the case its output on a terminal
stopped in, else in halves -- and a difference is confirmed on its case
alone. Each finding is reduced -- one factor at a time toward its simplest
level, while the case still makes the same kind of difference (a case that
does not build is asked of a build that stops at the C compiler's checks) --
to the factors it needs; a later finding that makes the same
difference and takes every level an earlier one needs is filed under it
rather than reduced again (its own program kept under `absorbed/`; which
findings are filed together can differ with `--jobs`). `summary.txt` under
`--out` (default `build/call-binding-probe/`, one run at a time) reports
three tiers: `wrong` (another answer, exception, order or exit status; C
that does not build; a compiler that fails without naming a construct; a
crash; a timeout; two cases that only fail together), `refused` (an
`unsupported` construct, a gap by the terms of
[`limitations.md`](../docs/limitations.md)) and `documented` (a difference
limitations.md gives as the answer, cited). Findings come in families by the
difference they make and shapes by the factors they need, with the reduced
case of each shape as a program of its own. It is a probe to run by hand,
not a gate: a pairwise run (`--strength 2`, about 510 cases) takes ten
minutes to an hour, most of it reducing findings, and a 3-way run (about
6000 cases) several times that. The answers are compared as they print,
exception messages included, so the reference is the `ruby` whose wording
Spinel follows (4.0); `SPINEL` names the compiler to probe (default
`./spinel`). Exit status 0 is no wrong answer, 1 a wrong answer, 4 the
tool's own error.

## value_flow_probe

`ruby tools/value_flow_probe.rb [--strength T | --random N] [--seed S]` asks
CRuby and spinel the same reads of a value that may be nil, case by case,
with the options, tiers and output of `call_binding_probe` (whose runner,
`probe_common.rb`, it shares; its default `--out` is
`build/value-flow-probe/`). Spinel keeps an Integer or a Float that may be
nil in the slot's own type, with a sentinel for nil (`SP_INT_NIL`, a NaN
payload), so every read of such a slot has to ask for the sentinel and every
carrier that moves the value has to keep it marked; a read or a carrier that
does not reads the nil as a number. A case, generated by
`value_flow_gen.rb`, is one row of its factors: where the value comes from
(a literal nil, a nil stored in a typed array and read back, an out-of-range
read, `c ? nil : 1`, a missing splat element, an optional's nil default, or
a present value as a control), what carries it (a local, an instance, global
or class variable, a block, proc, lambda, method or `Method#call` parameter,
a method's return, an attr_reader and an aliased one, a Struct member, a
Hash value, an Array element pushed, written in a literal, stored with
`[]=`, left in a gap past the end or appended through a reader, an element
read through a poly handle, a local a lambda captures, and the block
parameters of `each_with_index`, `map` and `each_slice`), the read (47: `p`,
interpolation, `nil?`, `===`, `case`/`when`, a Hash key, searches, `join`,
`sum`, `max`, `sort`, `<=>`, `pack`, conversions, arithmetic, `||=`, splats,
`zip`, `then` and more), the slot's type (Integer or Float), the top level
or a method, and `--int-overflow=promote`. Every carrier takes a present
value first, which types the slot, and each case prints the read of that
value, of the source's, of a nil the carrier makes of its own (a gap, a
short row), and, for an Array read of an Array carrier, of its whole Array,
so a finding's kind names the first line that differs (`source: value` is a
nil read as something else, `array: ...` a typed Array that holds one). The
call-binding probe prints what it binds with `inspect`, which already reads
the sentinel as nil, so it does not see this family. A pairwise run (the
default: 1175 cases, taking all 2165 pairs of levels) takes about ten
minutes at `--jobs 2`, and half an hour more to reduce what it finds; like
`call_binding_probe` it is a probe to run by hand, not a gate.

## nil_narrowing_probe

`ruby tools/nil_narrowing_probe.rb [--strength T | --random N] [--seed S]`
asks CRuby and spinel the same reads after a fact that proves an Integer or
Float local non-nil, with the options, tiers and output of
`call_binding_probe` (whose runner, `probe_common.rb`, it shares; its
default `--out` is `build/nil-narrowing-probe/`). The nil narrowing (#6481)
drops the nil test of a read it proves non-nil, so a wrong proof answers a
number for a nil without a word. A case, generated by
`nil_narrowing_gen.rb`, is one row of its factors: the fact (a guard on the
local in each of its forms, a write, the found-flag window with writes of
the flag and the local on each side, a raise or exit the program defines,
or an index read under `while i < a.size` and its spellings), the breaker
between the fact and the read (a plain write, a proc, lambda, Fiber or
stored proc that writes the local, a method that yields to a block that
does, by send, `method(:m).call` or instance_exec, a rescue that retries,
an ensure, a redo, a loop of each kind, a case/when or case/in arm, a
multiple assignment, `&&=`, `||=`, instance_variable_set), where the nil
it writes comes from (an Integer parameter that may be nil, or a value typed
nil), the compare or arithmetic read last, the local that carries the value
(a local, a method's or a block's parameter), its type, and for an index
read the array's slot (a local or an ivar), a call on it that may answer the
array itself (CRuby's own list: the methods that answer their receiver with
or without a block, and the Enumerators whose `each` does), where that
answer is held (a local, a method's answer, an ivar, a Hash value, a Struct
member, an attr_reader, instance_variable_get, a user `each`'s kept block
value, `super` in initialize) and the write through it that leaves a gap or
a nil. Each case is a method run four times, the fact kept and broken, and
each run prints `p`, the reads that do not raise for a nil, and the last
read, so a finding's kind names the run of the first line that differs
(`break: no-raise(NoMethodError)` is a nil the breaker left that read as a
number). Most of what it finds on master is older than the narrowing: to
tell the two apart, run it again against a spinel whose narrowing is
switched off (`nn_fresh` in `src/analyze.c` answering 0) and compare the
case files. A pairwise run (the default: 2810 cases, taking 5598 of the
7392 pairs of levels; a pair another factor rules out, such as an alias for
a guard, is never taken) takes about ten minutes at `--jobs 2` with
`--no-reduce`. On master most of its several hundred findings are older
bugs, so reduce only a run whose findings are few. Like the other probes it
is a probe to run by hand, not a gate.

## Adding a tool

Drop `tools/<name>.rb` (subset Ruby, `require_relative "tool_common"`
for the shared helpers); `make` compiles it to `build/spinel-<name>` and
`make install` installs it. Keep it within the subset -- a tool that
stops compiling breaks the build.

## spinel diff

The same program under CRuby and under Spinel, compared mechanically:
stdout, the uncaught exception (as `Class: message`, without the
backtrace) and the exit status, after the parts no two processes share
are folded (`#<Foo:0x...>` addresses, the program's and the scratch
directory, wall-clock times) and, under a ruby older than 3.4, the
spellings Spinel writes the 3.4 way (`{"a" => 1}`, `undefined method 'x'
for nil`). A difference is confirmed against a second Spinel run before
it is reported: a program whose output changes per run is
`nondeterministic`, not a bug in either runtime. The rules live in
`diff_normalize.rb` and the labels in `diff_classify.rb`, each with a
corpus test (`test/tools_diff_*.rb`); the end-to-end leg is
`make diff-test`.

```
spinel diff FILE.rb [--no-minimize] [--emit-issue PATH] [--timeout SEC]
                    [--ruby PATH] [--keep-tmp] [-- ARGS...]
```

Exit status: 0 same, 1 a difference (`output-diff`, `exception-diff`,
`timeout`, `nondeterministic`), 2 `compile-error` / `link-error`,
3 `crash`, 4 the tool's own error. This is a contract for CI.
`--no-minimize` is accepted ahead of the minimizer, which does not exist
yet. Not normalized on purpose: Hash order (the language defines it),
`object_id` values (indistinguishable from data) and `rand` (Spinel's
generator is not CRuby's).
