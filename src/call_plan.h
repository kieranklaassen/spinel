/* call_plan.h -- the user method a call binds, resolved from the tables.

   cplan_user(c, id) answers which user method the call node `id` reaches
   -- the method scope, the class whose chain was searched, the arm kind
   (UC_*, compiler.h) and whether the class tables already decide the
   dispatch (one method, or a switch over overrides) -- from the scope and
   class tables and the settled node types alone. It never runs inference
   and never emits, so asking it changes nothing (#7100, Phase B).

   A plan is memoized per node, but only where the node is read as itself:
   no view, no instance_exec scope move or class, no inline splice. Inside
   one of those it is computed afresh and not kept. Nothing reads it to
   emit yet; --plan-check compares it with inference's record and with the
   binding codegen made. */
