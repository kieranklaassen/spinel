# A conditional value stored into a String variable that holds a shared
# handle is stored arm by arm. An arm nested deeper than the arm walk goes
# (each pair of parentheses counts) is stored as a value of its own, its
# effects run: it was read as nil. Only conditionals count toward that
# depth, not the parentheses around an arm, though a sequence ending in a
# handle variable (`(1; s)`) still hands it over. An ivar's write beside a
# raise arm is stored as its String. Run with and without --share-strings.
